# MyReads Project

This is the MyReads project that lets you play around with your own personal bookshelf. You can search up books and add them to 3 different shelves on your app.

## Instructions

1. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
2. Start the development server with `npm start`
3. Look at the current books displayed on your shelves. 
4. Press the green button to see available options to move the book.
5. Click on the search button (+ sign) and search up the books you want.  *SEE IMPORTANT DOWN BELOW*
6. Press the green button to see available options to move the book.
7. Once book as been moved, simply go back to the main page and notice where the book was placed.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
